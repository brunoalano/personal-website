Researcher in Artificial Intelligence, focusing on Natural Language Processing, Behavioral Psychology, and Temporal Networks. CTO at Neurologic, managing technical staff and creating an online behavior analysis platform with real-time, highly predictive responses.

I am interested in democratizing access to mental health through artificial intelligence, not as a substitute for the therapist, but as an added dimension to the traditional process.

### Research
In the research area, mainly in recurrent neural networks applied to language or human behavior, has an emphasis on:

* \- Zero-shot Learning
* \- Transfer Learning
* \- Recurrent Reinforcement Agents
* \- Structured Prediction (Recursive Networks)
* \- Improve NLP corpora in Brazilian Portuguese

### Past
I've been studying artificial intelligence since my 14 years old, and software development since 08 years old (with Visual Basic 6). At the age of 12, I wrote a Ragnarok Online server emulator, which at the time was closed source, and involved a reverse engineering process based on incoming client TCP packages. At 14, I received an invitation from the Finnish government to attend an event in Helsinki. From the age of 18, I was the only Brazilian invited to participate in the annual OpenAI meetings.
